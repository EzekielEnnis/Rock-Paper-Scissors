# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a project assigned by The Odin Project

This was my first time implementing java script into one of my own pages. There were lots of mistakes made but also learnt alot to uses next time. 

Still trying to figure out how to best structure CSS but its getting a bit easier.

I plan to come back to this or remake it in the future when my skills have improved
